The Land Price Prediction project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the market value of land based on various features like location, area, proximity to amenities, and more. Built with Python, the project provides accurate, data-driven insights to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

Optional: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering and selection

Model training, validation, and comparison

Price prediction based on user-input features

Model performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score

How it Works
Data Collection: Dataset containing land-related features (location, area, road access, nearby facilities, etc.).

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features.

Model Training: Multiple ML models are trained and evaluated.

Prediction: The best-performing model is used to predict land prices on new, unseen data.

Visualization: Insights and patterns in data are visualized to enhance understanding.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
-----------pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
-----------jupyter notebook land_price_prediction.ipynb
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook/script to train the model and make predictions.
